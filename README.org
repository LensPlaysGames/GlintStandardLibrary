* Glint Standard Library

The standard library for Glint, the language covered by [[https://github.com/LensPlaysGames/LensorCompilerCollection/blob/main/docs/glint/thebook.pdf][this book]] and compiled by [[https://github.com/LensPlaysGames/LensorCompilerCollection][this compiler]].

We provide useful and common solutions (via Glint modules) for problems that you have already solved before, like reading a file, or doing certain string things, or whathaveyou.

See the documentation in [[file:docs/all.org][docs/]].
