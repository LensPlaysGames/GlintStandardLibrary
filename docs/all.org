* Glint Standard Library Documentation

# DEVELOPER NOTE: If a module declares a type, it should define a
# format() for that type as well. If someone has something from the
# standard library, they should be able to print it...

# DEVELOPER NOTE: Just because it's in libc doesn't mean it needs to be
# in Glint Standard Library. And vice versa. We may have to use non libc
# code to implement /some/ of this stuff.

* =io= Module (export import path)
- =File= type and functions to populate/operate it
- file size()
